# Overview

Welcome to **Dogeis Diep**, a diep.io private server created with diepcustom!   
There are over 50+ tanks, features and additions for you to play around with, and more features are being added almost every day! I encourage you to invite your freinds!

You can level up to level 60 but stop growing at level 45, level 60 tanks/tier 4 tanks are avialable! Hold K to level up and press O to retry.

**Discord:** N/A (May change later)
